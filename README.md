# weather-app

This is my attempt at the Weather App assignment for The Odin Project:

GH pages link:

This was a really fun project and by far my most productive on a personal level. This is also my first attempt working with APIs and manipulating that data, and for some reason that just allowed me to go off in many different directions and learn a lot of concepts throughout this development.

Key things learned/implemented

- API calls
- parsing JSON data
- error handling
- DocumentFragment
- CSS mediaqueries and keyframe animations

I'm sure there is other things as well but those are what stood out the most. I will continue working on and adding things to this project like more detailed weather info (wind direction, precipitation estimates, alerts if they exist, more precise location estimations), but the base functionality is complete in it's current form, barring any bugs I haven't found yet.
